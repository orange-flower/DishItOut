# DishItOut

Dish It Out is a 2D cooking card game where players can competitively race against another checf to collect recipes all while enhancing their knowledge of different cuisines.

On your turn, you have three options: 

- Select 3 different ingredient cards
- Select 1 ingredient card to get 2 of the same ingredient
or purchase a recipe card
- To buy a recipe card, you must already have all of the ingredients that the recipe calls for.

On the left of each recipe card, you’ll find listed the ingredients you need to have in your inventory to be able to buy that recipe.

Each recipe card is worth a certain number of points. Keep an eye out for this on the top right corner of each card.

These points are important — to win, you must reach a total of 10 points before your opponent does.



Happy cooking!
