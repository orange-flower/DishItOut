# DishItOut

Hello, little chef!

There are many recipes and skills you have to learn before you can be a professional chef.

Good thing you have me to guide you!

Through this game I’ve set up for you, you’ll race against another chef to collect recipes and enhance your knowledge of different cuisines — scaling your way towards culinary mastery.

Let’s get started!

When it’s your turn, you will have three options: 

- Select 3 different ingredient cards
- Select 1 ingredient card to get 2 of the same ingredient
or purchase a recipe card
- To buy a recipe card, you must already have all of the ingredients that the recipe calls for.

On the left of each recipe card, you’ll find listed the ingredients you need to have in your inventory to be able to buy that recipe.

Each recipe card is worth a certain number of points. Keep an eye out for this on the top right corner of each card.

These points are important — to win, you must reach a total of 10 points before your opponent does.

Feeling good, little chef? 

Happy cooking!
